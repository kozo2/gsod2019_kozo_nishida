<hr />

Probably the most common use of expression data in Cytoscape is to set the visual attributes of the nodes in a network according to expression data. This creates a powerful visualization, portraying functional relation and experimental response at the same time. Here, we will walk through the steps for doing this.

<hr />

# Installation
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

if(!"RCy3" %in% installed.packages())
  BiocManager::install("RCy3")

library(RCy3)
```

# Getting started
First, launch Cytoscape and keep it running whenever using RCy3. Confirm that you have everything installed and running:
```{r}
    cytoscapePing()
    cytoscapeVersionInfo()
```

# Prerequisites

The exercises require you to have certain R packages installed.

```{r}
install.packages("httr")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

# Loading Network

- Download the [demo session](http://nrnb.org/data/galFilteredSimpleData.cys) and open the demo session using

```{r}
library(httr)

cys_url = "http://nrnb.org/data/galFilteredSimpleData.cys"
GET(cys_url, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".cys")))
openSession(tf)
```

- When the network first opens, the entire network is not visible because of the default zoom factor used. To see the whole network, we can use the `fitContent ` function.

```{r}
fitContent()
```

# Label the Nodes

- Zoom in on the network so that node labels are visible.
- Check available column names.

```{r}
getTableColumnNames('node')
```

- We are going to use the COMMON name attribute to give the nodes useful names:

```{r}
setNodeLabelMapping('COMMON')
```

- Verify that the node labels on the network have changed to their common names.

# Color the nodes

- Check available column names again

```{r}
getTableColumnNames('node')
```

- Check the expression value range of **gal80Rexp**

```{r}
gal80rexp.score.table <- getTableColumns('node', "gal80Rexp")
gal80rexp.min <- min(gal80rexp.score.table, na.rm = T)
gal80rexp.max <- max(gal80rexp.score.table, na.rm = T)
print(gal80rexp.min)
print(gal80rexp.max)
```

- The following produces a default gradient ranging from blue to red for expression values. Notice that the nodes in the network change color.

```{r}
setNodeColorMapping("gal80Rexp", c(-gal80rexp.max, 0, gal80rexp.max), c('#0000FF', '#FFFFFF', '#FF0000'))
```

- The network should now look like this:

# Set the Default Node Color

Note that the default node color of pale blue is close to the color range in the created palette.
A useful trick is to choose a color outside this spectrum to distinguish nodes with no defined expression value and those with slight repression.

- Here we choose a dark gray color for default node color.

```{r}
setNodeColorDefault('#A9A9A9')
```

- Zoom out on the network view to verify that a few nodes have been colored gray.

```{r}
fitContent()
```

# Set the Node Shape

We imported both expression measurement values and corresponding significance values. 
We can use the significance values to change the shape of the nodes so that measurements we have confidence in appear as squares while potentially bad measurements appear as circles.

The following code maps the node with gal80Rsig value less than 0.05 to RECTANGLE shape, with greater than 0.05 to ELLIPSE shape.

```{r}
gal80rsig.score.table <- getTableColumns('node', 'gal80Rsig')
```

```{r}
getNodeShapes()
```

```{r}
setNodeShapeMapping('SUID', row.names(gal80rsig.score.table), ifelse(gal80rsig.score.table$gal80Rsig < 0.05, "RECTANGLE", "ELLIPSE"))
```

- Verify that some nodes now have a square shape.
